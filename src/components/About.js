I have always dealt with computers from a young age and have consistently held a fascination with them. When I first entered the workforce at a local retail company, due to my persistent effort and dedication I was promoted within one year to a supervisor role. I continued this position for the next four years until realising that this was not my end goal. After discovering Web Development, I came across a newfound exhilaration in learning it!</p>
